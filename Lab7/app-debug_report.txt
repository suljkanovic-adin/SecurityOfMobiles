    Please check whether the focusRequester is FocusRequester.Cancel or FocusRequester.Default
    before invoking any functions on the focusRequester.

- 
   FocusRequester is not initialized. Here are some possible fixes:

   1. Remember the FocusRequester: val focusRequester = remember { FocusRequester() }
   2. Did you forget to add a Modifier.focusRequester() ?
   3. Are you attempting to request focus during composition? Focus requests should be made in
   response to some event. Eg Modifier.clickable { focusRequester.requestFocus() }
